# Nutritional Risk Analysis of Fast-Food Diets

This project is a data analysis study focused on assessing potential health risks associated with long-term consumption of food from a single fast-food restaurant.

The analysis is based on nutritional data and compares estimated daily intake with recommended norms provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).

## 📌 Project Motivation

Fast-food restaurants are widely accessible, and many people consume meals from the same chains regularly.  
The goal of this project is to explore how a diet based exclusively on one restaurant may affect health over time.

The project compares multiple restaurants and evaluates deviations from recommended nutritional norms, as well as potential short- and long-term health risks.

## 🗂 Data Preparation

- Missing values (NaN) were analyzed and treated as zeros based on their position and frequency.
- Non-informative features (e.g. columns with constant values) were removed.
- Median dishes were used to represent a typical meal from each restaurant.

## ⚙️ Methodology

Two simplified nutritional risk models were developed.

### Model 1 — Satiety-Based Intake

This model estimates daily nutrient intake based on a custom satiety formula:
Satiety = (2 × protein) + (1.5 × fiber) + (1 × fat) − (0.5 × sugar)
**Satiety score**  

- Protein and fiber were weighted higher due to their strong influence on satiety.
- Sugar was assigned a negative weight due to its association with rapid hunger return.
- A satiety score above 60 was considered sufficient for one meal.
- Daily intake was estimated assuming three meals per day.

This model highlights nutritional imbalances even when subjective satiety is achieved.

### Model 2 — Energy-Normalized Intake

In this model, meals were scaled to meet daily energy requirements exactly.

The focus was shifted toward:
- cardiovascular risks
- metabolic disorders
- micronutrient deficiencies
- digestive health

## 📊 Risk Assessment

Health risks were categorized by:
- severity (high risk, moderate risk, minor impact)
- estimated time of symptom onset (weeks, months, long-term)

Restaurants were ranked based on cumulative risk scores.

## 📈 Results

Both models indicate that exclusive long-term consumption of fast food is associated with:
- elevated cardiovascular and metabolic risks
- micronutrient deficiencies
- digestive system issues

Although the models are simplified, the overall conclusion remains robust across assumptions.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Individual dietary preferences were not considered.
- Behavioral factors and food variety were not modeled.
- Median dishes may not accurately represent real eating patterns.

## 🔍 Future Work

Potential improvements include:
- modeling individual food choices instead of median dishes
- incorporating dietary behavior and social factors
- combining nutritional risks with lifestyle-related risks

## 🧪 How to Run

Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
